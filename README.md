# Blind Auction
A simple terminal-based Blind Auction application built with Python. This program allows multiple users to place secret bids, and at the end of the round, the highest bidder wins.

In a blind auction, each participant submits a bid without knowing the bids of the others. After all bids are in, the auctioneer reveals the highest bid and the winner.
